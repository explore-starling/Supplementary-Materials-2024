METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: DeepLabCut (v. 2.3.10; Mathis et al. 2018), Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS; v. 8.17.1; Friard & Gamba 2016).  See [Trapp et al.] for full details.

Methods for processing the data: R code written by Rebecca Trapp and Samuel Trapp.  See [Trapp et al.] for full details.

Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: R (v. 4.4.0), RStudio (v. 2024.04.1). Packages: tidyverse, dplyr, emmeans, factoextra, lme4, psych, afex, moments, survival, survminer, TraMineR, TraMineRextras, reshape2, nlme, rstatix, ggh4x, GGally, VGAM, tables, flextable, devtools, maditr, DescTools, ggplot2, ggsignif, ggfortify, ggbreak, ggalluvial

Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: p-cutoff of 0.6 in DeepLabCut

Environmental/experimental conditions: Included in Condition_Data.csv

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: Spot-checked head angle accuracy with protractor on screen.

People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: Rebecca Trapp


DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: allboris.csv

Number of variables: 21

Number of cases/rows: 1114

Variable List: <list variable name(s), description(s), unit(s) and value labels as appropriate for each>
"Observation id" > name created for observation file; [initials of observer]_[metal id #]
"Observation date" > date and time observation was conducted in BORIS
"Description" > contains notes about the observation (e.g., ended early, bird is never on screen)
"Observation type" > method of conducting observation (always via media file)
"Source" > location of media file used
"Total duration" > total length of media files (in seconds)
"Media duration(s)" > length of each file separately (three videos make up one trial) (in seconds)
"FPS (frame/s)" > frames per second for each media file (always 59.940 fps)
"Box Type" > treatment puzzle box type ("Control" [renamed Blocked Control in R code], "None" [renamed Open Control in R code], "Lift", "Push", "Slide")
"Subject" > individual ID (metal band)
"Behavior" > specific behavior seen, not used in final analysis ("Start", "Probe", "Closed Peck", "Open Peck", "Pecks Box", "Foot Touch", "Lid") see supplementary materials (Trapp et al.) for ethogram
"Behavioral category" > broader definition of behavior ("Start" (start of trial), "Top Beak Touch" ("Probe", "Closed Peck", "Open Peck"), "Bottom Beak Touch" ("Pecks Box"), "Top Foot Touch" ("Foot Touch"), "Box Solve" ("Lid"))
"Modifier #1" > added detail to behavior, not used in final analysis ("Vertical", "Horizontal", and "Angled" applied to "Top Beak Touch" based on peck angle; "Obstructed" and "Unobstructed" applied to "Bottom Beak Touch" based on whether the contact was visible or inferred; "Moves" and "Opens" applied to "Box Solve" to differentiate moving the lid and fully opening it)
"Behavior type" > either Point event or State event (always point)
"Start (s)" > time that behavior started (in seconds)
"Stop (s)" > time that behavior ended (always the same as start, since there are no state events)
"Duration (s)" > duration of behavior (always NA, since there are no state events)
"Media file name" > full location name of media files used
"Image index start" > frame that behavior started
"Image index end" > frame that behavior ended (always the same as start, since there are no state events)
"Comment start" > contains any comments added regarding a specific behavior
